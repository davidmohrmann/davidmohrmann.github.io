    <h2><span>About Me</span></h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm David Mohrmann. I am a developer at The Iron Yard in Durham, NC. Currently I am in the Python/Data Science Course.
      Over the last couple of weeks we have done assignments ranging from building simple
    python programs to more complex, machine learning applications. Most of what we have done
    has involved data analysis in some sort or another. We are now entering the final weeks of the cohort
    and are learning web development. It seems pretty cool thus far; it is my first day using HTML or CSS and our assignment is to design a website much like this.

    <p> Ultimately, I want to begin a startup. My interests include: sports, retail, and data, which I hope to incorporate into my business. </p>
